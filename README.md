# TableCheck Data Operations Take Home Project

Take a look at the dataset located in `/data/data.csv`. Your goal is to interpret it and create a dashboard providing the answers to the following questions:
  - [ ] How many customers visited the "Restaurant at the end of the universe"?
  - [ ] How much money did the "Restaurant at the end of the universe" make?
  - [ ] What was the most popular dish at each restaurant?
  - [ ] What was the most profitable dish at each restaurant?
  - [ ] Who visited each store the most, and who visited the most stores?

## Tasks

- [ ] Create a backing database and ingest the data from this dataset.
- [ ] Create a dashboard.
- [ ] Document your solution.

Please document your solution, and provide answers to the following questions at the end as well.
* How would you build this differently if the data was being streamed from Kafka?
* How would you improve the deployment of this system?

Remember to provide a link to your dashboard as well.

## Questions
### What library should I use?
There is no limit on the choice of library, language or other semantics. Use what you are familiar with and what you would recommend.

### How should I ingest the data?
You can use any method you like to ingest the data. You can use a script, a tool, or even a direct database import if your chosen database supports that. The only requirement is that the data is eventually stored in some kind of database.

### How should I create the dashboard?
You can use any tool you like to create the dashboard. You can use something prebuilt like Grafana, or an BI tool like Tableau or Google Data Studio. You can also create something using a library like Streamlit. The only requirement is that the dashboard is accessible via a web browser.
